This repository contains a **Model to forecast Sunspots** based on the dataset available at the [Machine Learning Mastery website](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-datasets-for-machine-learning/). It's objective was the creation of a model to predict shampoo sales. This project was set up following the premises of [Reproducible Research](https://pt.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research), so that anyone can achieve the same results as me using the steps I followed in Jupyter Notebook.

# Project libraries


All dependencies can be found in the file  `requirements.txt`, but are also listed below:
* Numpy
* Scikit-Learn
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* Matplotlib
* statsmodels

To install the dependencies run in the project's main folder : `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

To access the Jupyter Notebook that I created, run in the root folder of the `jupyter notebook` project. Soon after, your browser will open and just select the file `Forecasting passenger traffic.ipynb`.  

# Project structure

```{sh}

  |- Sunspots.ipynb
  |- requirements.txt
```

The folder `report` contains an md file with a version of the report generated from the study done on that project. This file contains **all the insights and studies that were done, as well as a detailed description of how the project was developed**.

**All references used to create this project are described in the report**.
